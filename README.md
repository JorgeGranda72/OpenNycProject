# Introduction

This notebook aims to explore trends in recent data on motor vehicle collisions. Project members can have a fuller understanding of the content, timing, frequency, and location of collisions. This notebook seeks to contribute to that understanding through the exploratory analysis and visualization of vehicle collision data.

# Data Source

The data used in this notebook was obtained from: 

- [NYC Open Data's Motor Vehicle Collision-Crashes](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95)
  - This dataset contains information from all police reported motor vehicle collisions in NYC. Each row represents a crash event.The police report (MV104-AN) is required to be filled out for collisions where someone is injured or killed, or where there is at least 1000 dollars worth of damage. This notebook uses a subset of the data and was accessed with the [Socrata Open Data (SODA) API](https://dev.socrata.com/consumers/getting-started.html).
